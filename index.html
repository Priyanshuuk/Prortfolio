       <div class="text"><p>Hi, I'm Priyanshu Khulbe, a passionate developer with a strong
         interest in creating innovative and useful applications. I enjoy working with various technologies and solving real-world problems through code. Here’s 
         a bit about the skills I've developed and some of the projects I’ve worked on:</p>
         <br>
         <br>
         <p>Skills:
         <p> Web Development: I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I’ve used to build dynamic websites and web applications. I recently worked on a web application called "The Odin Recipes," where users can browse and view recipes for their favorite dishes like Pizza, Burger, and Noodles. I also integrated basic interactivity to make the user experience seamless.</p>
         <br>
          
          <p>Face Recognition and Machine Learning: I’ve worked with OpenCV and machine learning algorithms to create face recognition systems. I developed a face recognition system using the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) algorithm for marking attendance. This system involves capturing face samples, training a recognizer, and recognizing faces in real-time to track attendance for users, making the process efficient and automated.</p><br>
          
          
          Python Programming: My expertise includes writing Python scripts that utilize libraries like OpenCV for computer vision, pandas for data manipulation, and datetime for working with timestamps. I used these tools to build practical projects, such as the attendance system with face recognition mentioned earlier.</p>
