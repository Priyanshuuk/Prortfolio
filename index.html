      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Priyanshu Khulbe. I'm a developer who enjoys building useful
        applications that solve real problems. I like working with different programming 
        tools and technologies, and I’m passionate about creating things that can make life
        easier for people. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><h2>Skills :</h2></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Web Development: I know how to create websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
         I built a simple website called "The Odin Recipes" where people can look up recipes for foods like Pizza, Burgers, 
         and Noodles.I made sure it’s easy to use and interactive for a better experience.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Automation: I’ve worked on projects where I automated tasks to make processes more efficient.
         For example, I built a system that automatically marks attendance based on facial recognition.
          This system reduces manual work and makes attendance tracking quicker and more accurate.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Python Programming: I write Python scripts for different tasks, like processing data and working with images. For example, I 
        used Python to build the face recognition system mentioned above, and I also used it for other projects involving data manipulation.</li>
      </ul>
